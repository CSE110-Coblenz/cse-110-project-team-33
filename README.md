# CSE110 FA25 Group 33: Arc-haeology

*Hey, you must be the new Arc-eologist! Welcome to the PI-yramid!*


Arc-haeology is a small web-based game designed to challenge young (7-9th grade) students' understanding of basic trigonometry concepts. It was developed by four CSE undergrads at UCSD for the class CSE110.
It was written in 5-7 weeks, entirely in Typescript + Konva!
