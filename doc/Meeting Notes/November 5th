What will I do?
Cailey: Create local data structure for player data and inventory.
Connor: Work on settings UI and pull request for level 2.
Janeen: I will work on pixel art designs for the menu, settings and anything left for the levels. I will implement a load UI and the logic to list all of the saved games and to load that saved game. Finally, I will code review one of my team member's merge request.
Sonia: Work on main menu UI.

Am I stuck?
Cailey: No.
Connor: No.
Janeen: I am sort of stuck on implementing the logic to load previously saved runs of the game, but I will as my team members for ideas if I get completely stuck during development.
Sonia: No.

Other Notes:
- Added issues to Sprint 2 (main menu, player data, design, settings, start game/load game/exit game, mini games, code reviews).
- For each issue, added assignee, priority, and estimate.
